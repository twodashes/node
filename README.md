# Utility functions **for Node.js**

See also: [@twodash/universal](#) and [@twodash/browser](#), which are structured the same way, but are less pure and more platform-specific. Planned for the future are more platform-specific functions: "@twodash/rnative" for React Native, "@twodash/ionic", and in a galaxy far far away "@twodash/quasar".

# Installation

These are exported for your choice of environment. When importing, specify **cjs**/**esm**/**\_\_** format. The **\_\_** is meant to be used with the browser `<script>` tag. It creates a `window.__` variable.

```JavaScript
  import { sort_by_rating_and_position } from "@twodash/universal/esm/sort_strings"
```

```JavaScript
  const sort_strings = require("@twodash/universal/esm/sort_strings")
```


# Documentation

# Not ready

Currently under development. Not stable. Adding more functions.
